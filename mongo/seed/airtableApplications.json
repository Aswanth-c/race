    "description": "Habit Hero helps CEOs, sales teams & marketing departments develop habits statistically proven to drive higher income, confidence, happiness and more...\n\nHabits missing from their daily routine - and if fixed - will drive better results, in life, business, career, and relationships.",
    "projectGoal": "I'll answer this first:\nHow do I plan to MEASURE success?\n# of 5-star reviews, referrals & year over year retention of members.\n\nWhat I hope to accomplish:\nRevolutionize the self-help, fitness & business coaching industries.\nFlip education & training on its head.\nInstead of stuffing people full of know-how first. \nLeaving them to figure it out on their own.\nGive them to dos.\nBased on evidence-based practices. \nThen coach/educate through the sticking points & bottlenecks.\nThis includes using a GPT-3 chatbot using a knowledge base of the greatest works of the greatest minds.. Plus our most well-established & authoritative studies.\n\n\nWhat does success look like?\nSuccess looks like creating a tool which cuts through the fluff.. Someone can check boxes for the goals they want. For health, wealth, love & personal relationships..  Instead of having to read 100 books. Listen to 100 podcasts. Go to 15 multi-day seminars.. They choose outcomes. Get a simple starting point of daily + weekly disciplines they need to follow.. Which grows, evolves & adapts with them.\n\nBecomes more specialized & specific as they demonstrate proficiency.\nOr supports them where they are weakest.\n\nThe personalized coaching experience we all want & need.\n\nFOR EXAMPLE:\nIf someone says they want to look good naked.\nBelieve it or not... It doesn't require a 4-year undergrad degree.\nDoesn't require reading 1,000 books on the subject. \n\nMy point is it's not for a lack of knowledge.\nIt's failure to consistently execute.\nOR choosing the wrong mentor and getting misinformation.\n\nIt requires a whole-food, plant-based, high protein diet.\nBroccoli & chicken have near-zero prescription drug contraindications.\nOr if they don't want animal protein.. Broccoli & Tofu.\n\nFollowed by consistent physical activity. Both low-impact activities like walking.. As well as exercise programs. Yoga. Weight lifting, etc..\n\nFor the general population, vague prescriptions partnered with habit/behaviour tracking and coaching around needed behaviour modifications can get 80% of the work done.\n\nANOTHER EXAMPLE:\nIf someone wants to grow a company.. Outreach out to as many ideal prospects as necessary to have 100 conversations = magic. They don't even need to have a sales agenda. No sales tricks. Just honest & focused conversations around the specific problem this company desires to solve.. It will open up partnership opportunities, lead sources, high-impact insights into buyer wants, needs & desires. \n\nI'm giving very simple and superficial examples.\n\nMy underlying point is most people don't need another book.\nThey don't need the next seminar.\nThey don't even need the next software tool.\nThey don't need a habit tracking app or programs letting them 'create their own plan'. Which is where the current tools lead people astray.\n\nMost people don't know what habits they need to get where they want to go.\n\nSo giving them a tool to track the things they 'guess they need' is a disservice.\n\nThey need to say \"my goals are __\" and then start tracking what gets done.\n\nThey need a simplified plan flexible with the ebb & flow of life.\nDo \"this behaviour\", \"this often\". \n\nTHEN, they need support & coaching around the outcomes.\n\n\nFor the sake of being polite... I'll get off my soapbox and end this here.\n\nSummary:\nHow do I plan to MEASURE success?\n# of 5-star reviews, referrals & year over year retention of members.\n\nWhat I hope to accomplish:\nProvide SAAS 'just in time' coaching. \nPeople choose their desired outcome.\nGet starting habits based on evidence-based practices. \nThen coach/educate through the sticking points & bottlenecks. \nOr increase the depth of details as proficiency is demonstrated.\n\nFor more info, contact me at: daryl@bestbusinesscoach.ca",

Players : Who are playing the game\n2. Creators: Community creators who create tracks, new cars and earn\n2. Track, factory, club owners: Game owners who will host the core components\n\nOnce we are confident that the network is self sufficient, we will burn all dev owned components other than the genesis race track and handover the reigns to the DAO.

    "pitch": "The tax situation in many countries, but notably the U.S., is difficult to navigate when receiving tokens as compensation. Receiving the tokens triggers a taxable event, which would be difficult to deal with when payed over time at various intervals (dependent on employer). This project I'm building would be a twist on the typical swap protocol. \n\nFor example, an employer would lock up 1 years worth of tokens (A tokens) into a private pool, and an employee would lock up the equivalent value in collateral, a stable-coin in this case (B tokens). The employee and employer each own 50% of the pool and can only draw up to their allotment. The employee would ideally take all the A tokens immediately (if they would assume the token would increase over time). This would trigger their taxable event, but if it's done fast it could be considered a wash since they also posted an equal amount of B tokens to the private pool.\n\nThe employers ownership over the pool would then degrade over time at a rate pre-determined between both parties, while the employees ownership would appreciate. This would constitute the slow compensation over time to the employee, but it's happening with the B tokens in the pool instead of the projects A tokens, which are all in the employee's wallet.\n\nTax rules are fluid and change constantly, but they also move somewhat slowly. This project would allow many people to receive compensation in tokens they (hopefully) believe will accrue in value, receive those tokens in a favorable tax event, and still be on the right side of the legal framework in the U.S. as well as other possible countries. The employer would also be in a safe spot in case the employee leaves, since they'll have collateral equivalent to the time not worked (of an arbitrary time interval) by the employee.\n"

Because Katherine is an artist, we've always been interested in creator problems and leveling the playing field for small artists and creators. We also love learning by building and exploring new spaces—we dove head-first into web3 and NFTs just a few months ago, and are already deeply-embedded in the Solana ecosystem and have launched several web3 products (https://www.producthunt.com/@katherine_liu/made).

During the pandemic she started Meridrop—her own creative studio specializing in joyful prints and surface pattern designs (meridrop.com). Since August of last year, Katherine has licensed her art to several brands, launched a Skillshare class, and been commissioned by the City of Palo Alto to create a public mural.\nMatt is constantly learning and building. At Facebook, his projects ranged from designing and implementing an IPC protocol for AR/VR devices to building an entire product at Facebook NPE. In his free time, he writes long tweet threads about Solana, builds side projects, and makes the occasional YouTube video or Medium post. \n\n",

Previously, he was a software engineer at Facebook, where he worked on integrity and AR/VR. The most difficult thing he's done is recover from multiple concussions—he spent all of Caltech dealing with post-concussion syndrome and migraines. He recovered after 5 years (seeing a neurologic physical therapist was the biggest help).\nOur company, FormFn, is right at the intersection of Solana and creator tools—we're building the Solana NFT marketplace focused on independent creators and their needs.\n",
    "pitch": "Creator-first, 1/1-focused NFT marketplaces on Ethereum do a lot of business. Platforms like Foundation and SuperRare have done tens of millions in volume in just the last month—but we think these numbers could be so much bigger. \n\nRight now, only the tiniest slice of all creators are actually making NFTs. The majority of artists are shut out of platforms like Foundation and SuperRare, for two main reasons. 1) Most artists can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars listing their art with no guarantee of a sale, and 2) Artists are afraid of getting canceled for listing on platforms that have a large environmental footprint. \n\nBuilding on Solana rather than Ethereum would alleviate both of these issues and open up a huge, untapped market of talented creators. The only problem? There are no 1/1-focused NFT marketplaces on Solana! Right now, all the big Solana marketplaces are entirely focused on collections (e.g. 10K PFP projects).\n\nThat's why we're building FormFn, the best marketplace for 1/1 NFTs on Solana. We're creating a 10x better experience for both creators and collectors, and setting the foundation for an NFT ecosystem that's driven by independent creators rather than collections. \n\nWhy now? The market for NFT collections on Solana is quickly saturating—there's a ceiling to how many clubs people can join and be active in (buying into a collection is essentially like joining an exclusive club). The other big opportunity is winning the NFT game on mobile. Phantom wallet is adding mobile support in January, opening the doors for FormFn to be the best mobile experience for discovering and trading NFTs in Solana (or even the entire NFT ecosystem). \n\nWe know NFTs aren't going to stop at 1/1 art—but that's just our initial wedge. Our long-term vision is to let independent creators use NFTs to fund their own dream projects, from indie video games to films. For example, if a creator wanted to create a short film, they could sell NFTs of their film characters, use those funds to create the film, and then pass some of the profits from the film back to the original NFT collectors. This turns collectors into advocates—now they have some skin in the game, and have financial incentive to see these creators and their projects succeed. \n\nWe believe this is going to be the funding model for all creative projects in the future—from films to books to video games to music releases—and that FormFn is going to be where it happens.\n\nWe're incredibly excited to empower the next generation of creators through FormFn—and if you are too, we'd love to chat.\n"

    "pitch": "**Mission**\nOur mission is to preserve humanity's most important memories.\n\n**Vision**\nOur vision is to build a meaningful bond between the metaverse and the physical world by anchoring real-life memories and virtual assets to real-world locations that are owned by people. \n\n\n**What is Metablox**\nMetablox is a Web3 platform where users can own representations of real-world places as an NFT.\n\nWe believe that memories are important to humankind. With the advent of Web3, there is an important opportunity to help people own their memories and anchor them to real-world locations, building community and opening up opportunities in the metaverse.\n\n\nWhere we're going with this -- as seen from the lens of our 4 user personas:\n\n**The Nostalgic Neighbor**\nThe Nostalgic Neighbor has the comfort and satisfaction of owning their most precious memories, forever on the blockchain. When they have a life milestone, such as an engagement, a baby, or a career move, the Nostalgic Neighbor captures the memory in a photo, video, gif, or audio and adds it to their home in Metablox.\n\nAs the Nostalgic Neighbor grows older, they pass on their Metablox NFTs to their children, who continue the legacy of documenting the family’s most important memories. After many generations, the entire family tree and legacy is captured on the blockchain so that all family members understand and appreciate their family history.\n\n**The Museum Curator**\nThe Museum Curator proudly owns and curates a community or a landmark. They have spent years, maybe even decades, collecting the best memories in that area: memories from a myriad of people, dates from a year ago to decades ago, and even curated what kind of NFT art is for display. \n\nSan Francisco is known for its wonderful street art and culture. People from all over the world come to take tours of the street art and to listen to the rich history of the city. \n\nBy becoming the bridge between the metaverse and real life, people in the city will be able to walk the streets of cities all over the world and see the magnificent memories and NFT art that the Museum Curator curated. \n\nIf and when we succeed, we envision a world where tourists experience the culture of a city through their own eyes and through the lens of the Museum Curator.\n\n**The Real Estate Mogul and the Neighbor Collective**\nThe Mogul and the Collective strive for asset appreciation. To this end, they will compete to capture the most valuable places in Metablox -- the landmarks. \n\nBlock by block, city by city, Moguls and Collectives need to buy homes in order to amass enough MetaRent to outbid the other. To further increase the velocity of their MetaRent, Moguls and Collectives will seek to purchase high level homes and communities driven up in level by Nostalgic Neighbors and Museum Curators (high level homes earn more MetaRent).\n\nIf and when we succeed, Moguls and Collectives will amass wealth through the economics of buying and selling landmarks and high-level homes.\n\n"

However, each collection is unique and the artist is empowered to creatively direct the NFT composition. Artists can also drop mp3 files only and let the community play with those by either making remixes or visual art that can be retroactively airdropped to NFT owners.\n\n Each NFT holder has access to a private discord with the artist, all of our live events, and will receive limited edition apparel tied to the NFT collection. NFT holders will also get airdropped a governance token to help shape this brand.\n\nThe artist gets ~80% of the mint proceeds (it's up to the artist, but this is what we suggest), ~8% on secondary sale royalties, and they decide how much IP they want to give away.

Plantoids are digital native plants, that live and grow on-chain, and that capture 100X as much CO2 as real world plants.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Birth: a plantoid is born by generating and minting an NFT that contains solely a random set of traits (DNA) that will determine the characteristics of the plant. DNA NFTs are stored on Solana due to low transaction fees and low CO2 emissions. \n2. Growth: each day, plantoids grow and evolve based on the weather, and their own traits. The weather is derived from entropy coming from the BTC blockchain, in a way that we achieve random results yet every plantoid has the same weather conditions. And then each plantoid, depending on their DNA, reacts differently (some tolerate the sun more, others can work with less humidity, etc.). Plantoids use a generative Lyndenmayer System to look similar to real world plants\n3. Care: plantoids must be taken care of, like a tamagotchi. Their owners must water them, change their soil, and fight off bug infestations to ensure they remain healthy. These operations are all persisted on chain and require a custom token ($WATER). Users will receive 90D of WATER when they purchase a plantoid\n4. Share: plantoids can be viewed on our website, but they can also be shared in any digital surface, from twitter banners or 3D metaverses to digital frames. Show the world you care and actively donate for CO2 captures by showing off your plantoid. We will provide a default renderer as well as an API and docs to create your own renderers. \n5. Trade: if you're lucky and pay special care to your plant, you may be able to produce unique offspring that you'll be able to sell or trade with others.\n\nWe're close to launch an alpha, however we're looking for funding to move faster, and grow the team. \n"

This will enable swift processing and accessibility of funds as we expect all transfers to be credited within 10-15 minutes and ready to be utilized for our users at a fraction of the transaction cost currently being charged by traditional financial institutions.\n \n We intend to build a robust compliance and KYC onboarding platform, to prevent potential fraud and build trust between exporters and importers by verifying both parties via our platform. The near-instant remittance settlement time will create a substantial increase in productivity and efficiency, as exporters usually wait for their deposits to be received before starting to work on their orders. This could lead to shorter lead and delivery times as well, which is greatly beneficial to the import companies as well.\n \nOur business model would generate revenue through several avenues, firstly by charging our users an annual or monthly account maintenance fee, as well as a minor transaction fee on each transaction and we will charge an additional minor withdrawal fee when user’s decide to withdraw funds when making an on-chain transaction or converting back into fiat.\n \nWe estimate that we will have to be loss making for at least the first 2-3 years of business operation, while we attempt to scale and onboard new users around the world and bring down our customer acquisition cost (CAC), once we hit a certain threshold of monthly active users, we are confident that we can build a business with sustainable positive future cash flow (FCF).\n \nOur main competitor’s would be companies specializing in digital wallets for cross border transfers such as BitPesa and Wyre. However, Bitpesa is currently targeting user’s that are individuals. While Wyre is focusing on business payment solutions such as payroll and bill payments, it does not focus particularly on B2B payments and cross border transactions. Another potential form of competition could be through the use of digital asset managers or crypto exchanges that allow onboarding of Import and Export companies, and they could engage in these transfers without Coin Remex. However, there would be additional risk of custodianship and exchange counterparty risk for the users.   \n \nWe will begin advertising and spreading the word of our service in developing countries that have many exporters that are currently struggling with financial infrastructure or with national currency instability such as Turkey, Brazil, Nigeria and have them promote our unique selling proposition to their overseas buyers directly via word-of-mouth.

She has seen the pitfalls of the current fragmented building industry around the world, and believes a change will have huge impact. She currently lives in a shared, co-owned home in the US.\n",
    "pitch": "Think about a time when you wanted to change a space you were in, but you were unable to do so because you didn’t have enough information about the existing structure to proceed. This happens regularly around the world, leading to poor occupant experiences and slowing down innovation in the building sector.\n\nReincent DAO creates a mechanism that incentivizes architects and construction teams to design and build spaces for easier maintenance, retrofit, and evolution. This enables more spaces that fit the needs of occupants and ensures spaces can easily upgrade for better climate, public, and collaborative health innovations.\n\nTwo different types of tokens govern Reincent:\n\nBEAM – A non-fungible token (NFT) that defines the space of each building. Each building has a set number of BEAM, based on its physical volume. BEAMs are specific to each physical building, but can have corollaries in the metaverse. \n\nREIN – A cryptocurrency that facilitates minting of BEAMs, and generates value as BEAMs are exercised. REIN can be used across buildings as a store of value.\n\nHere’s how it works: Each standalone physical building project has a set number of building block tokens, called BEAMs, pegged to the volume of the space. For each stage of the design, build, and retrofit process, each stakeholder can mint their contribution. Let’s say an architect designs a room with walls that makes it easy to locate the piping behind said walls. They mint that design, based on the attributed BEAM. Now it’s the builder’s turn to build the wall. They pay some REIN to access the design, build the design to spec, then remint that now-built structure. The architect gets a % of the REIN that was spent to access the design, and the builder will get a % of the REIN spent when the structure is further accessed. Let’s say now there’s an occupant a year later who wants to change the piping behind the wall to suit her needs. The retrofit team she hires can pay some REIN to access those BEAMs, get the correct detail about the existing project, and upgrade it further--reminting it in the process. As the space is used more, driving value to occupants, the value of REIN to the design and build teams also goes up.\n\nThe Reincent mechanism therefore a) incentivizes each stakeholder of the design, build, and operate process to access and document their work transparently, and b) gives each stakeholder incentive to contribute to a better final outcome-- a space that can more easily mold to the needs of occupants downstream.\n\nDAOs and web3 models are the perfect use cases for the already decentralized building industry. The Reincent mechanism can become the de facto tool for new DAO-based building projects, such as shared homes, neighborhoods, and new cities. Contributors to the Reincent DAO are critical to build the tools to facilitate the Reincent ledger, market its use across more and more building projects, and advocate its efficacy as a way to reframe stale permitting processes IRL.\n"

Seeing how other sovereign funds and communities supported their startups in Asia and Station F if France, made me want to launch [a different model for overlooked communities](https://medium.com/knowledge-capital/building-startup-ecosystems-the-knowcap-thesis-cd85557535bd).\n\n\n",

Up to this point, we have offered the ability for experts to work with our founders in exchange for carry if they commit 10-hours per week. \n\nWhat we've realized after doing this for two years and building a portfolio of 20 companies, is that by building a DAO we could effectively design a more optimal version of our investment model. We can have founders apply to our human capital investment program, the DAO would become our investment committee, choosing who would get in and who wouldn't. \n\nThen members of the DAO would have a list of tasks that are associated with our Startup Engine process (we've spent two years refining this process and know how much time each deliverable takes to build a company).\n\nAs a DAO, an expert can essentially log in whenever they want, check off a task and earn tokens. Currently, our model has no liquidity for our experts unless we experience an exit. By launching KCDAO, it means they have built-in liquidity via the tokens themselves. While our portfolio grows, others will want to join our community for access to the deals that we will create via our portfolio (think 10% discounts on 100 products). We will create various rewards to redeem tokens, this will allow other experts to buy tokens from each other...redeeming them will recycle the tokens as a micro-economy inside our DAO. Rewards will consist of events, experiences, raffles, merch, and other benefits that will cost tokens. Keeping everything on the platform is a way that we can continue to bring on more experts without launching multiple DAOs. **Our goal is to build this one into a portfolio of at least 100 companies. **\n\nWhat also stands out is that we can offer participating founders tokens in our DAO as well - Incentivizing them to help each other succeed in the portfolio. We also envision this opportunity will get us into amazing deals (even if they fail they still own tokens that represent the value of a fund invested in other companies). Lastly, just like with the experts supporting the DAO, founders will have liquidity from the tokens that they can sell later on to pay for personal expenses, new employees, or international growth expenses. \n\n**Committing $1M to our project would give Hyperscale 2.5M of the 10M tokens.**\n\nThe funds will go to incorporating an LLC in Wyoming, giving us the ability to hold equity in other companies. It will also go to compensating experts who will receive bonuses for hitting specific token milestones. Lastly, the funds will go to marketing and building the infrastructure to support KCDAO. We have already minted the 10M coins on the Polygon mainnet.\n\nWe will not charge for our tokens - we want to avoid being perceived as a security that anyone can invest in (i.e. crowdfunding). Tokens will have to be earned by experts, founders will have to agree to our investment terms, and selling will have a lockup period where only accredited investors can buy tokens.\n\nIf they succeed our DAO succeeds and can build in more benefits into the membership value of each token. \n"

The recipient (amputee) **fills an application form** on our website or mobile app. The form guides them to **take photographs of the amputation** in certain formats. The suitable** prosthetic design will be determined automatically** from the form. Required **parameters will be calculated from the photographs** automatically and be used to **create the custom 3D print files** using the chosen reference parametric design files. A qualified **volunteer in the network gets assigned to the specific recipient** and receives the 3D print files. The** volunteer prints, assembles, and ships the prosthesis**. When the **recipient approves the prosthesis, the volunteer gets paid in community tokens**. Community **tokens can be exchanged for 3D printing materials or cash and they can be used for voting rights**. Community **tokens are minted from donations** and can be rewarded to volunteers that work in the development of the software, 3D designs, and other areas the community sees as valuable. \n\nThis project **follows the tried-and-tested workflow of the existing volunteer groups but automates the 3D print file generation, matching of volunteers and recipients, and resource distribution**.

    "pitch": "Imagine a project on the blockchain that allows artists from all over the world to submit their art. Right now, if you wanted to create an NFT collection as an artist, you'd need to hunt down a developer with blockchain experience, develop a marketing strategy, secure a spot on a secondary marketplace after minting — and if you don't have any capital to begin with, hope that you can find all of those services for free. Unless you have the funds or a large following, you have nothing to leverage. What a shame, especially if you have serious artistic talent.\n\nARTSYBOTS is an NFT project on the blockchain that aims to give talented artists a piece of the pie through royalties and the power of the community. The process is simple: artists will submit artwork to the community, and when NFTs that contain their artwork are minted, they will be set up to receive royalties. The system is designed to ensure that each approved piece of art is included in the collection at least once, or more, depending on how the artist wants to distribute their royalties. Typically, artists only receive royalties if they are a core member of the team that created the collection. These teams are difficult to break into and the community ends up looking like a pyramid. I believe this is why ARTSYBOTS needs to happen. Artists will have a chance to succeed without having to deal with the hurdles that discourage so many people from trying.\n\nI am very excited for the opportunity to contribute back to the community by leveraging the power of web3 and NFTs.

He was in a dark place around the time I joined the web3 community amid family problems and his friend's suicide, and the enthusiasm for better days he shows whenever I conuslt with him on our project serves as priceless motivation to share our product with the world. Furthermore, the topic of mental health has become increasingly important to me after my close friend also passed away from suicide last year. I've become outraged at the hyprocrisy of the predatory behavior of big-pharma while products such as CBD and cannabis offer viable methods to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression that have plagued so many over the past couple years. Knowing my product can create true impact keeps a fire under my ass.\n\nSecond of all, I think you guys should know that our tea is really, really good.

    "pitch": " As early adopters we have two primary opportunities: creating the infrastructure around web3 to bring it mainstream, and onboarding new people into the community by making “this whole crypto thing” seem less abstract. \n\nOur functional wellness CBD beverage brand is committed to doing the latter by mixing the familiarity of a refreshing  tea with the novelty of blockchain by utilizing token based loyalty programs and governance systems for our customers and NFT artists. We partnered with food scientists at the University of Arizona to create a delicious product that community members can proudly drink to preserve their wellbeing and show the public that they are part of a new era of innovation, financial freedom, and digital ownership. We are happy to see people proudly displaying their NFT pfp's representing their membership in the community, and hope to give them the same opportunity to show their web3 enthusiasm in the physical world by repping their NFTea beverage.\n\nA core tenet of our brand is a focus on serving the NFT photography community by partnering with emerging artists to launch joint collections that bring together a diverse range of talent for the collective good of growing the community and increasing the value of the artist’s work. Showcasing emerging artists will be a central focus of our marketing campaigns, with featured artists being highlighted in our packaging, online content, and eventually real world art galleries. We hope to transition to a DAO-based model after launch, which will enable community members to vote on which art should be included in future collections, as well as have a voice in branding and company direction decisions. Funds from the DAO will be used to collect art from more established artists and bring them into the community, which will provide the exposure and networking opportunities for earlier artists in the community to increase the value of their work.\n\n"

    "pitch": "Most Nigerian languages, and most African languages are horribly under resourced despite having millions of speakers. The universal dominance of English and French, as well as the various histories of colonialism on the continent have created an increasingly worsening situation where fewer African children are learning their own languages, and even adults are losing their fluency.\n\nThe resulting problem is that many African languages are in danger of disappearing or at least becoming severely threatened within the next 50 years.\n\nThere is an existing market both in Africa and the African diaspora all over the world for language lessons and language teaching in African languages, but the demand is poorly met, and even where offerings exist, the quality is poor, and mostly offline / not well suited for the digital world.\n\nSexy Igbo already has paying monthly customers who use it for Igbo learning, and if funded to expand to include other languages, there are millions of potential customers who would appreciate a Duolingo contender that addresses the unique problems posed by African languages.\n\nSexy Igbo addresses this problem (using the Igbo language as a prototype, but with the intention to expand to other Nigerian, and then other African languages) by offering a comprehensive language learning system designed to teach learners from absolute scratch with constantly evolving material supported by a continuous research effort to not only cover the existing breadth of the language's grammar, vocabulary, syntax, and cultural nuance, but to also develop and coin new words to plug the vocabulary gap for new technology that Igbo (and many other African languages) lacks.\n\nIgbo is tonal (as are most Nigerian and African languages), and is not well served by the existing Latin writing system. As such, most speakers are heavily discouraged from writing, and have lost the ability. Ndebe as a script not only makes writing a tonal language easy and enjoyable, but works for other similar / related languages such as Yoruba, Itsekiri, Ikwerre, Ngwa, Ika, and Ezza.\n\nThe combined application of the language learning system of Sexy Igbo, and the tonal writing system of Ndebe, will allow Fluent Nigeria to scale to include as many of the 300+ languages spoken in Nigeria alone, and the hundreds of languages in the Niger Congo language family, especially the Kwa language group.\n"

    "pitch": "dFlow's system was borne out of a market-neutral crypto hedge fund. We used Tagomi (acquired by Coinbase) and other providers, and found them lacking and error-prone. So we spent years integrating into the major exchanges (and soon decentrazlied applications such as DEXs and AMMs and other DeFi protocols) and building the best price execution system on the market.\n\nWe spent an inordinate amount of time building this system and felt that it wasn't accruing enough value (in ratio to time spent on it). The idea was to try productize this software. The first test we ran was providing price execution for a Top 100 protocol to liquidate a proportion of their treasury in the open market. We successfully conducted the order across multiple exchanges, providing 8x better pricing (as they usually did OTC trades via Coinbase) and earning $40k over 4-months. We have only tested this one paying customer but feel with 1x front-end and 1x back-end hire we could conduct more effective tests to prove out our hypothesis:\n\n1\\. DAOs, protocols and crypto-native startups will need tooling for effective treasury management. One element of that is pricing. DAO members do not want to think about how to execute the best price, and often just want convenience at a fair price. Hence they turn to OTC trades with c. 10% slippage at worst given a lack of alternatives. dFlow will be a simple, convenient solution that allows DAOs (and others) to manage their treasuries at the best prices in the market.\n2\\. The nature of the infrastructure in the crypto industry means that small to mid-sized hedge funds can be started out of ones bedroom. However, these managers do not have the right tooling to execute trades in size with minor slippage. Emerging managers will use our software instead of building in-house, and dFlow will \"arm the rebels\". \n\nWith the correct syndicate of VC backing, we can really accelerate our growth (VCs tend to have multiple startups in their portfolio with these needs, so partnering with VCs is the ideal fit). \n\n\n"

I’ve written a bit about my personal motivations below; they’re not entirely decision-relevant.\n\nMy objective is to build new “young people systems” that encourage and support curious, creative, and eager young people to STOP shoehorning themselves into existing systems and getting jaded by all of the simulacrum worship rampant in today’s society. For example, we worship prestigious universities, jobs at top companies, making a lot of money, etc. For kids who actually like learning and creating things, seeing their peers stuck with these mindsets is naturally confusing and frustrating.\n\nObviously, this sucks. I want to fix it. The idea that everybody needs to go to college to learn, listen to superiors for the “right” values, and accept a traditional career to pay the bills is now outdated because of the Internet. People can now self-learn whatever they want to learn, self-reflect on things they see online to find their own values, and self-express their own skills and identity to support themselves through Patreon, social media, crypto, businesses, etc. Most people know this, but the legacy systems are still viewed as the “gold standard” because of fear and habit. We know technology will change this over time. I hope to build some of it.\n\nI also practice what I preach: I’m slowly reteaching myself calculus w/ proofs, reading an undergrad physics textbook to build physical projects later on, dabbling in urban planning to eventually create a free housing project, cleaning up my theoretical CS fundamentals, and reading a bit of Girard and Nietzsche as a change of pace. Wouldn't it be great if I had a chain of proof to show to you? :)\n",
    "pitch": "A social media-like UI will allow for the following uses:\n\n- If I want to build a portfolio of work that demonstrates I’m a self-taught engineer, I can submit images of problem set solutions, videos of my annotated textbooks, weekly progress updates, and other artifacts of progress as demonstration of credibility. In other words, I’m building my “chain of proof,” which I can stake to raise capital or get contract work.\n- If I want to request a $5000 grant to work on an idea-stage project, I can request funds from others in the network and specify an outcome that I’ll have to demonstrate in order to maintain the credibility of my “chain of proof.” If I fail to prove that I have reached my outcome, it is recorded as a black mark against my chain of proof. If I succeed, it adds to the credibility of my chain.\n- If I take on a software development contract, the result is based on voter-miners who have reviewed the initial requirements, the project delivered, and the conversations among client, contractor, and voter-miners. This eliminates the need for trust, as coins and chains are transparently staked and voter-miners are incentivized to resolve the situation accurately.\n- If I want to sell an on-chain NFT that I promise will convert into some physical good (i.e. a future event pass, whose logic cannot be programmed into a Smart Contract), I can stake my chain; any future NFT holder who claims that I broke my promise can make a claim to black-mark my chain. Projects like Gary Vee’s Vee Friends are doing this, but Gary Vee has an off-chain reputation to stake; ChainRep makes it easy to build a reputation to stake.\n\nA natural marketplace will develop, in which funders and employers will balance decisions based on the length of one’s chain (risk) and the amount requested for a grant, contract, or other item (cost). We will build filtering tools and recommendation engines to encourage transactions.\n\nWith ChainRep, trust in credentials and networks is converted into consensus-based verification and transparent reputation, thus dramatically increasing access to opportunity.\n"

There are other novel applications of the blockchain which I will go into further detail on later but this is a foundation which makes those other things and many more possible.\n\nMeanwhile, if any of what I have said rings true, I highly recommend considering supporting another endeavour of mine: a feasible and economical solution to climate change. The early research in 2020 that myself and my business partner at the time were doing was showing promise but was thrown into disarray when I was forced into exile.

    "additionalDetails": "This system largely solves cryptocurrency’s energy wastage problem because proof is being provided by the natural highest and best use of computers: storing and organizing useful information efficiently.\n\nWhile there is a technical benefit to having 10% of all payments made on the blockchain be evenly-distributed amongst all verified accounts, there is a social benefit in the form of universal basic income, which to anyone that believes in human’s fundamental desire to be productive rather than unproductive, is an abundantly good thing.\n\nThe policies around (a) investing money into the success of one’s peers, (b) protecting copyright and protecting fair use and (c) data privacy and control are messes that better technology can clean up. There are other novel applications of the blockchain which I will go into further detail on later but this is a foundation which makes those other things and many more possible.\n\nMeanwhile, if any of what I have said rings true, I highly recommend considering supporting another endeavour of mine: a feasible and economical solution to climate change. The early research in 2020 that myself and my business partner at the time were doing was showing promise but was thrown into disarray when I was forced into exile. It would cost a tenth of one Tesla car to determine whether it is a technology worth pursuing further.\n\nFinally: our society has lost its appetite for heroes. Usually bold statements like many I have made here would be censored, one would in so many ways be branded a heretic by the morality of psychiatry (“suspicion is a symptom of disease but being too trusting is also symptom of disease”, “fixation is a symptom of disease but not fixating enough is a also symptom of disease” and, most of all, “acting in one’s own self-interests, over that of the diagnostician, is a symptom of disease”) and the full, megalithic weight of bureaucracy would be brought to bear.\nHowever, now there is an alternative. I not only make this message inimitable and permanent, I build proof of its authorship more and more over time. These antagonistic forces are ones that we, together, shall overcome. The hour is late.

Some countries today lack the financial infrastructure for SME’s and Large-scale businesses to prosper in today’s digital economy, cross border and domestic bank transfers can sometimes take multiple days or weeks to settle and can incur large transaction fees. Certain countries have also been excluded from the global financial system altogether i.e. Iran, Venezuela and Sudan to name a few. How do we expect honest businesses from these countries to grow and engage in global trade if they do not have an opportunity to do so? \n\nCoin Remex will be a platform to enable importers and exporters to transfer digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), as well as stablecoins such as USDC, USDT via our platform. Partnering with commercial banks around the world, we reduce risk and fraud by letting them verify our transactions on a L1 Blockchain (TBD), attached in the transaction data we will include essential shipping documents such as Invoice, Packing List and Bill of Lading (BL). This will enable swift processing and accessibility of digital currency funds as we expect all transfers to be credited within 10-15 minutes and ready to be utilized for our users at a fraction of the transaction cost currently being charged by traditional financial institutions. And likewise same day availability funds in fiat for customers who need to make payments in Fiat. "
